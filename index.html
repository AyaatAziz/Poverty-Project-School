       <h3>Infilation rates has significantly decreased after the pandemic ended. In June 2022 it was as high as 8.1%. Due to this increase in poverty, people started to lose jobs and couldnt afford to pay basic needs like water or food due to extremly high expenses. In March 2024 the rates have dropped to 2.9% just the slight increase in gas prices. That is a drastic change. Canada is working hard to stop poverty.</h3>

        <h1>What next steps are Canada planning to take to reduce or even stop poverty?</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>The Canadian government is already investing about $10 billion to stop poverty. They didn’t wait to do this action, they did it immediately. They gave it to new refugee families in need and many more. Also Ontario’s new housing plan makes homes more affordable for immigrants arriving in Canada.
